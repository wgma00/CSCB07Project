CSCB07Project
-----------------------
Here's a live demo of our CSCB07 final project. We were tasked with creating a flight booking system for a client. This took us over a month to complete as we had followed test driven development and had to attend regular weekly scrum meetings to get it right.

Here are some fun statistics that were done after the project was completed.
